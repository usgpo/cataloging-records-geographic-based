# CGP Geographic-Based

## General Information
Library Services & Content Management (LSCM) of the U.S. Government Publishing Office created this repository. Metadata and Collection Services (MCS), formerly Library Technical Services (LTS), creates and maintains the collections in the repository.
This repository contains sets of bibliographic records in the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) based on geographic coverage and governmental jurisdictions and reports about the records. The records have been extracted using a list of MARC metadata elements. Our intention is to provide a new product for Federal depository libraries to develop and manage their collections and the GPO records in their catalogs and systems.

We selected a group of MARC fields and subfields to identify records that are related to a particular state or entity. We use the full names, abbreviations, and adjectival forms of the names as the match points. The records have been named and placed in folders corresponding to their [National Collection Service Area (NCSA)](https://www.fdlp.gov/about-the-fdlp/national-collection-service-areas).

## Repository History and Versions

GitHub uses a versioning system to provide access to the iterations of a repository. This enables a user to return to the state of a repository before the various changes ("commits" in GitHub terminology) that were made to it.

**To see a list of versions of the repository as a whole, follow these steps:**

- Click or tap on "commits" in the top right-hand section of the page
  - ![Image shows pointer to 'commits' link in upper right-hand of main file list](images/commit_history_link.png)
- On the "Commits" page, choose the date of the version to be retrieved and then click or tap the "Browse the repository at this point in the history" link.
  - ![Image shows pointer to "Browse the repository at this point in the history" link](images/browse_history_link.png)
